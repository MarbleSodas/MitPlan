# FFXIV Mitigation Planner Refactor Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to improve the efficiency of the FFXIV Mitigation Planner application without affecting its functionality or styling. The refactoring focused on optimizing performance, reducing unnecessary re-renders, and improving code organization.

## Key Changes

### 1. Component Structure Reorganization

- **Split App.jsx into Layout Components**
  - Created `AppLayout` component for the main container
  - Created `HeaderLayout` component for the header section
  - Extracted styled components to separate files

- **Created Dedicated Components**
  - Moved `DragPreview` to its own component file
  - Extracted styled components to the `components/styled` directory

### 2. State Management Improvements

- **Memoized Context Selectors**
  - Used `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when context values change
  - Optimized context usage in the App component

- **Colocated Mobile State**
  - Created `useDeviceDetection` hook to handle mobile detection
  - Moved mobile detection logic out of App.jsx

### 3. Effect Optimization

- **Optimized Effect Dependencies**
  - Improved useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Added early returns for empty dependency arrays

- **Throttled Resize Handler**
  - Implemented throttling for resize event handlers

### 4. Performance Patterns Implementation

- **Memoized Expensive Operations**
  - Used `useMemo` for expensive render operations
  - Memoized list rendering for boss actions and mitigations

## Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Re-renders**
  - Memoized component rendering for lists
  - Optimized effect dependencies

- **Optimized State Updates**
  - Improved state update logic
  - Added early returns for conditional effects

- **Improved Code Organization**
  - Better separation of concerns
  - More modular component structure

## Testing Strategy

To verify that the refactoring has not affected functionality:

1. **Visual Testing**
   - Compare the application's appearance before and after refactoring
   - Verify that all UI elements render correctly

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Test all user interactions (drag and drop, selections, etc.)
   - Verify that all features work as expected

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Use React DevTools Profiler to measure render counts
   - Compare performance metrics before and after refactoring

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing virtualization for long lists
- Further optimize context usage
- Add performance monitoring tools
